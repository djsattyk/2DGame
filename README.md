Background Inheritance
Using inheritance to design the background of a 2-D video game
In this project, we are going to see how to use inheritance to create rich backgrounds such as those used in the earlier Zelda and Pokemon games. Use this document to prepare for the lecture.

Tasks

Download the code from here (click the download button at the top of the browser window). Spend some time(15-20min) just exploring the code. Focus on the Area and OurArea classes. Use these questions to guide your thought process
How is the grass and stones getting drawn on the screen?
What code would I need to add to get the fire image drawn on the screen?
BONUS: How are the trees getting drawn? What code would I need to add to get the tree_2.png image on the screen?
Take a look at the below resources to get an introduction to inheritance. Now think about how we could restructure our code to simplify adding different types of tiles such as fire
Hint: What are the grass, stone, and fire all examples of? What code do they share to get them drawn on the screen?
Write down any questions that come up and ideas you have to explore during the lecture
If you have time, explore designing your own level, either with the images already provided or by importing your own images. (Tip: the size of the tiles is 64 x 64 so if you want to import your own image, it should be that size).
Importing the Code

The link above is an Eclipse project. To import it to your eclipse go to File --> Import

Then select the project folder InheritanceBackground (which should be in your downloads folder) and click open and then click Finish. You should have the project imported into your eclipse.
Resources

Here goes some resources that might help you with inheritance. You by no means have to look at / watch them all, I just like to provide variety.
